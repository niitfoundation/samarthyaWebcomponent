Dynamic Component Rendering 

    In Samarthya we have develeoped Dynamic Components for rendering view of candidate profile and edit of candidate profile.
    By using Angular.io we are able be create only one Component and used it to render multiple type of elements like
    -text with icon
    -text with title
    -plain text
    -chips
    -input box
    -label
    -dropdown, etc.

    For rendering UI Components in Samarthya we have to provide the data and config with the "sam-profile-view" tag.
